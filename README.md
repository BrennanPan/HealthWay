# HealthWay2.0
Created by Nyan Prakash, Shaunak Sinha, and Brennan Pan as a project at a Carnegie Mellon University Hackathon.
HealthWay is a personalizable website that provides health recommendations to users based on data gathered from third-party pollen, weather, and air quality APIs. My specific contributions were on the backend working with the pollen and air quality APIs.
